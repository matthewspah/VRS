# VRS
chromedriver.exe https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Download all 4 files, run pip install -r requirements.txt

change the .env accordingly.

login vrs with chrome, make sure the windows user will be the same user that is going to run the script.

To workaround with the login, the scripts now use your chrome profile which means you will need to have chrome installed and login VRS at least once, after that you can run the script and it should work.

There are currently some bugs to work out but here is the reddit page for it:
